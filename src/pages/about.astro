          Hi! I'm Akshat. I'm an engineer passionate about solving real-world problems through intelligent systems. My 
          work spans everything from high-performance AI agents and backend engineering to autonomous technologies - always grounded in a deep curiosity 
          for how things work and how they can be improved.
        </p>
        <p>
          To me, science and engineering are a lot like solving mysteries. Each problem hides a set of clues, and as engineers, 
          we're the detectives - designing machines, building systems, and following signals until the pieces click into place. That 
          process of discovery and invention is what keeps me curious.
        </p>
        <p>
          On this website, I share about ideas, research, and reflections on building next-gen AI. I believe technology, when 
          applied thoughtfully, can tackle some of the toughest problems out there and I'm here to keep exploring where that can lead.
        </p>
        <p>
          If this resonates with you, I'd love to connect - whether to exchange ideas, collaborate, or just have a thoughtful conversation.
        </p>
